# Conditional Expressions (CASE, IF, COALESCE, NULLIF, TRY)

## Use CASE to combine market segments and do 'what if' analysis
presto> select
     ->   case mktsegment
     ->     when 'FURNITURE' then 'HOME'
     ->     when 'HOUSEHOLD' then 'HOME'
     ->     else mktsegment
     ->   end as mkt, avg(acctbal) as avg_bal, count(1) as cnt
     -> from mysql.test.customer cust
     -> group by
     ->   case mktsegment
     ->     when 'FURNITURE' then 'HOME'
     ->     when 'HOUSEHOLD' then 'HOME'
     ->     else mktsegment
     ->  end;

## IF statements can achieve the same effect when nesting, but can get cluttered
presto> select
     ->    if (mktsegment = 'FURNITURE', 'HOME',mktsegment)
     ->    as mkt,
     ->   avg(acctbal) avg_bal
     ->   count(1) cnt
     ->   from mysql.test.customer
     ->   group by if(mktsegment = 'HOUSEHOLD', 'HOME', mktsegment)
     ->   ) ;

## COALESCE helps to replace null values
presto> select coalesce(hs_rank, 99) as rank, state
     -> from mysql.test.us_grad_rates
     -> order by coalesce(hs_rank, 99);
